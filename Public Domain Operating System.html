<h1><b>Welcome to PDOS (Public Domain Operating System)
and PDPCLIB (Public Domain Project C Library)</b></h1>
<img src="pdwin.png">

<h2>There are two major components to the PDOS project:</h2>

   <h3> PDPCLIB: Public Domain C Runtime Library </h3>
   
<p>The most commonly used component, thanks to
<a href="http://gccmvs.sourceforge.net/">GCCMVS</a> (port
of GCC to IBM mainframe) is PDPCLIB which is a 
public domain C runtime library which you can link your
own C programs against to produce executables with no
licencing restrictions (even if you use a compiler,
commerical or non-commercial, that does have licencing 
restrictions).
PDPCLIB works on DOS, OS/2, Win32, PDOS, MVS (mainframe) and CMS.
The library conforms to the ISO/IEC 9899:1990 (aka
ANSI X3.159-1989 aka C90 aka C89) standard. It has no
extensions so is particularly good at finding out if
your code is truly portable.
</p>
   
   <h3> PDOS: Public Domain Operating System </h3>

<p>Secondly there is an operating system, with a user
interface as simple as MSDOS, but behind the scenes the
story is quite different. There are 2 completely different
APIs supported (MSDOS and MVS). The MSDOS API is supported
on both the 16-bit 8086 and 32-bit 80386. On the 80386,
it isn't really the MSDOS API, it is a theoretical
32-bit MSDOS API (note that while the API and applications
are pure 32-bit, it internally switches to 16-bit in order
to be able to use the BIOS, a fact that the application
and end user is completely unaware of). The 32-bit version
is now known as PD-Windows, as it supports some of the
Win32 API, allowing a subset of Windows executables
to be run. It sits on top of 32-bit PDOS/386.
The MVS API is 
supported on the 24-bit S/370 and 31-bit S/390 IBM 
mainframe hardware. The 31-bit S/380 from Jujitsu is 
also supported. The 16-bit MSDOS API and the 24/31-bit
MVS API are both able to run a subset of real-world
applications that were targetted to the original
environment that they are in some ways a clone of.

   <h3> Public Domain Software Philosophy </h3>

<p>It is hoped that programmers from around the world who subscribe
to <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/pdos/gitcode/ci/master/tree/pdpgoal.txt">this</a>
worldview will make themselves available to push this project forward.
</p>

   <h3> Documentation </h3>

<p>You can find documentation for PDOS and PDPCLIB in text
files in the downloadables from the file area
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/pdos">here</a>.
</p>
   
   <h3> Miscellaneous Software </h3>

<p>There is also some miscellaneous programs with source
code there, including OZPD (snippets of PD code), PDPZM 
(public domain zmodem), PDCOMM (PD communication routines
for DOS, OS/2 and Windows), BBS-related stuff (Devil Dialer C,
RSEND, Tobruk), RZSZPE - a port of rzsz (zmodem) to DOS and 
OS/2, and PDCRC - a set of CRC routines.
</p>

   <h3> Contact </h3>
   
<p>
Most discussion of PDOS and PDPCLIB takes place
<a href="https://groups.io/g/hercules-os380/messages">here</a>,
amongst mainframe enthusiasts.
PDOS also has an IRC channel - irc.freenode.net #pdos .
PDOS is also mentioned in the alt.os.development newsgroup. 
Anyone interested in making (explicitly public domain) 
enhancements to either component is most welcome.
I also sometimes run a telnet server using PDOS under
qemu and you can connect to kerravon.mooo.com 64000
